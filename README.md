This study analyzes offline FIDE chess tournament data to explore the role of skill in the game of chess. Data of two time formats, Rapid and Classical, are analyzed using tools of exploratory data analysis and a 
predictive model is devised to predict outcomes of chess games between players of varying age and rating levels. Based on the predicted results between players of varying predictor levels, an intuitive measure of skill
in chess is proposed.
